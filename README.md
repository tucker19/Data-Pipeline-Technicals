# Data-Pipeline-Technicals

Welcome to my Technical Coding showcase. This is a repo of past take home technicals I have been given.

# Setup
Will need the Astronomer CLI and those instructions can be found on [Astro](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/install-cli) and will need to setup Docker/Docker-Compose. I would also advise having a Postgres Database on a separate machine to update `airflow_setting.yaml` file with to have data output there.

# Running
* Via the "astro" directory run "astro dev start"
* Via general directory run "docker-compose up -d"

# Take Home Technical in this Repo
* Fleetio
* Flipside
* Zelus
